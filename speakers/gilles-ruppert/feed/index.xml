				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The popularity of AngularJS has exploded over the past 12 months with over 20.000 starts on their Github page. Its goal to make web application development easy appeals to many developers. Indeed, seeing the demos of two-way data binding are impressive.</p>
<p>I have written my own MVC frameworks, worked on custom MVC frameworks and used a lot of Backbone in the past 5 years. Since mid 2013 I have worked on a sizeable AngularJS application and have found that the ease of the demos does not necessarily scale as you app grows bigger.</p>
<p>In this talk we look at the good, the bad and the ugly parts of AngularJS and how AngularJS 2.0 is addressing them.</p>
<p>Expect lots of movie screenshots and Clint Eastwood quotes <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
