				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Zendesk was one of the first companies to use Ember in a large scale production application. With over 200,000,000 users making 70,000 requests per minute at daily peak times, we&#8217;re pushing the boundaries of single page application development performance. Once the API stabilized, we&#8217;ve embarked on the upgrade path to Ember 1.X and wanted to share our best practices/lessons learned from this journey.</p>
<p>In this session, we&#8217;ll cover performance optimizations and design patterns used to achieve scalability including:</p>
<p>* Deferred loading<br />
* Boot optimizations<br />
* Using null controller pattern for performance<br />
* Proper usage of Ember primitives<br />
* Custom mixins<br />
* Working with high performance HTTP APIs<br />
* Ember core framework customizations</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll also talk about the challenges faced when migrating from 0.9X to 1.X and the tools we&#8217;ve developed to ease the transition, improve code quality, and speed up development as we&#8217;ve grown our codebase.</p>
