				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000;">NoFlo is a flow-based programming environment for JavaScript. Originally built for Node.js systems automation, it can also be used for developing full-stack applications from the browser to microcontrollers like Arduino.</p>
<p>With NoFlo developers build their applications by wiring data streams together between different pre-built or custom components. The NoFlo environment is fully browser-based and can connect to NoFlo instances running on remote servers, allowing inspection and rewiring of running software.</p>
<p>The NoFlo development environment is open source and was successfully crowdfunded on Kickstarter in fall 2013. Now it is time to show the world how it works.</p>
<p>You can learn more about NoFlo at http://noflojs.org/</span></p>
