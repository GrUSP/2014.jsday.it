				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone knows that acceptance testing is important, as ultimately the biggest test of your code is “does it do what its supposed to?”. But few people enjoy writing acceptance tests.</p>
<p>Several front-end acceptance testing frameworks (intern, dalek and nightwatch) have emerged in the past year, all designed to help you write clear, expressive, javascript-based tests that make sure your code works everywhere it runs. I’ll share my experiences getting real products tested using them, what they can do for you, and when you might choose to use one over another.</p>
<p>This talk is aimed at developers who may already be writing acceptance tests in something like Selenium or Cucumber, but would like to learn about alternatives and how they can make your life easier.</p>
