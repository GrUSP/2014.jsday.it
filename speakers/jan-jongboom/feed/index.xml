				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The past years there has been some heavy debate over web vs. native for mobile applications. But to be honest, it has never been a fair game as the web was lacking crucial functionality. No access to sensors, not available offline. Essentially: the mobile web is broken. Luckily if something is broken, we can fix it! Firefox OS, the new mobile operating system from Mozilla, runs completely on top of web technology. And that means that every cool and awesome feature in your smartphone now has a JavaScript API. So in this talk we&#8217;ll look at how the mobile web has progressed in the past years, how Firefox OS works and how to build for it, and how Firefox OS will be the driving force behind all innovation on the mobile web.</p>
